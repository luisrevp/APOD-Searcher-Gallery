              This is a simple project consisting of an APOD searcher (acronymn for 
              <br />
              "<span>Astronomy Picture of the Day</span>") from NASA, in which we can find
              <br />
              information about the pictures through a search bar, with
              <br />
              capabilities for sorting and assign a range of dates.
